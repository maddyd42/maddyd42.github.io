Hello! I'm Maddy, a third-year PhD candidate in the [Naeem-Palmer *Ecology With No Apology* Lab](https://naeemlab.com/) at Columbia University. My research focuses on understanding how ecosystem functions change as species ranges shift in response to climate change. Using a combination of fieldwork and remote sensing, I'm looking at the northward encroachment of mangroves into salt marshes along the Florida coast, and how this movement affects local biodiversity and impacts coastal ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling and sedimentation.
