Hello! I'm Maddy, a third-year PhD candidate in the [Naeem-Palmer *Ecology With No Apology Lab*](https://naeemlab.com/) at Columbia University. My research focuses on understanding how ecosystem functions are altered as species shift their ranges in response to climate change. Iâ€™m particularly interested in the northward movement of mangroves into salt marshes along the northeast coast of Florida, USA, and how this encroachment impacts coastal ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling, sedimentation, and biodiversity. Using a combination of fieldwork and remote sensing, my work aims to shed light on how these changes affect ecosystem stability and the broader implications for biodiversity conservation in the face of climate change.
